However, I do not support blocking roads to demand changes, as this action does not convince people. Instead, it makes people feel absurd and annoying, especially when someone is in emergency and they want to go to hospital for treatment immediately.

Massive disruption across North West Kent - it's not just the motorway affected. This is the traffic through the usually sleepy Hamlet of Bean; just off the Bluewater junction from the A2.

However, I do not support blocking roads to demand changes, as this action does not convince people. Instead, it makes people feel absurd and annoying, especially when someone is in emergency and they want to go to hospital for treatment immediately. In case they could not get treatment on time, their life will be at risk and protesters who blocks roads will have to take responsibility for their actions. #protests Just Stop Oil: What is it and what are its goals?\\n   \n",

Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand.

Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&amp;D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand. I’ll be available for work as of February 2023 and I can’t wait to discover what New Zealand has to offer. I would love to start discussions about expatriation experiences, tips about New Zealand, potential work opportunities (including remote), …\\n</td>\n",

Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand.

Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&amp;D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand. I’ll be available for work as of February 2023 and I can’t wait to discover what New Zealand has to offer. I would love to start discussions about expatriation experiences, tips about New Zealand, potential work opportunities (including remote), …\\n</td>\n",

Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand.

Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&amp;D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand. I’ll be available for work as of February 2023 and I can’t wait to discover what New Zealand has to offer. I would love to start discussions about expatriation experiences, tips about New Zealand, potential work opportunities (including remote), …\\n</td>\n",
